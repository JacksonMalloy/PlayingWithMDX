# Multi Stage Transitions

> This project was inspired by a design in my linked in feed.
> Props to <ExternalLink to="https://turtle.design/">Turtle Design</ExternalLink> for such awesome designs! I'm a big fan.

### Gatsby

I used <ExternalLink to="https://www.gatsbyjs.com/">Gastby</ExternalLink> as a base for the site. As a fan of GraphQL and React.js, picking a blazing fast static site
generator like Gatsby is my usual go-to for fun little side projects.

### Framer Motion

A production-ready <ExternalLink to="https://www.framer.com/motion/">motion library</ExternalLink> for React. It is by far the easiest and most powerful animation library out there.
I've tried React-Spring, and I do like it, but there's something about Framer that sets this one apart.
By leveraging Framer Motion with Gatsby I was able to create transitions that could happen over multiple state changes.
The animations are incredibly smooth and it leads to quite an interesting experience just by clicking a button.

### Speech Recognition API

So I found out the browser has a native <ExternalLink to="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/SpeechRecognition">Speech Recognition API</ExternalLink>.
It's not very supported but I thought why not try out something new!
At the time of writing, this API will only work with Chrome (Sorry Safari / Firefox users)! I brought this in through a custom hook,
and saved the output to a serverless database.

### FaunaDB

The output from the speech recognition API was sent to <ExternalLink to="https://fauna.com/">FaunaDB</ExternalLink>
and saved (without user consent lol). You'll find
a whole list of funny sayings at the end of the transitions.
