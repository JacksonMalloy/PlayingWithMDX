# App Devjacks

> This project consists of a full stack Single Page Application built with React.js and Node.js hosted on Heroku.
It uses multiple APIs including <ExternalLink to="https://cloud.google.com/dialogflow">DialogFlow</ExternalLink> (a Natural Language Processing service from Google)
and the <ExternalLink to="https://developers.google.com/calendar">Google Calendar API.</ExternalLink>




### Natural Language Processing
I was interested in integrating NLP systems to handle customer support with <ExternalLink to="https://six12creative.com">SIX12 Creative</ExternalLink>.
I found an awesome video by <ExternalLink to="https://fireship.io/">Fireship</ExternalLink> which you can see <ExternalLink to="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0NXqwT3Y09E&ab_channel=Fireship">here</ExternalLink>.

In my efforts to learn how to integrate Dialogflow, I built out a personal portfolio where the bot converses with the user and performs actions on the users intent. If their **intent** is to contact me, the agent will automatically set up an event in my Google Calendar using the Google Calendar API.
