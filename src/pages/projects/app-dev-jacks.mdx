# App Devjacks

> This project consists of a full stack Single Page Application built with React.js and Node.js hosted on Heroku. 
It uses multiple APIs including <ExternalLink to="https://cloud.google.com/dialogflow">DialogFlow</ExternalLink> (a Natural Language Processing API from Google) 
and the <ExternalLink to="https://developers.google.com/calendar">Google Calendar API.</ExternalLink>


### Natural Language Processing
I was interested in building out NLP systems to handle customer support with <ExternalLink to="https://six12creative.com">SIX12 Creative</ExternalLink>. In my efforts to learn integrating a NLP service such as
Dialogflow, I built out a personal portfolio where the bot will converse with the user and if their **intent** is to contact me, the agent will automatically set up
an event in my Google Calendar using the Google Calendar API.
