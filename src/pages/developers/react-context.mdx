# Lets Hook up Context

So there's this new pattern arising, I'm sure many of you have heard.
Sometimes it can be a bit fishy (if you catch my drift), but mark my words
once you learn how to create your own, it will improve the experience you have
working with your codebase significantly.

>Lets take a look at `useContext`.

The `useContext` hook is a hook to provide a sort of "global store" as you might call it;
a global, single location to store state for a specific service, a particular function, similar logic.

Lets take a look at a simple use case of `useContext`

```jsx:title=src/components.js {}
import React, { createContext, useContext } from 'react'

const SomeContext = createContext();

// In the parent component we provide the context to its children
const Component = () => {
    return (
        <SomeContext.Provider value={"hello world"}>
            <ChildComponent/>
        </SomeContext.Provider>
    )

}

// No state here (don't have to pass props!)
const ChildComponent = () => {
    return (
        <section>
            <GrandChildComponent />
        </section>
    )
}

// We can access whatever value was passed in the <Component>
const GrandChildComponent = () => {
    const value = useContext(SomeContext);

    return (
        <button onClick={() => console.log({ value })}>
            Click me
        </button>
    )
}

```
What's happening here is that we're creating a store in a parent component and **Sharing**
that store with the children, grand children, great grandchildren and all
the other generations of the family tree. This means that you can now access the prop `value="Hello World"`
from anywhere within the component tree, just by calling useContext! Pretty cool right!
Prop drilling can become a real problem and using context can save you from prop drill hell.

But what's the use of passing through just a single prop.
What if we want to share multiple values, multiple props through the same context.
What if we wanted to add methods to edit those values from anywhere within the children of our parent tree.
What about passing through state?

Lets start with something simple first.


```jsx:title=src/components.js {}
import React, { createContext, useContext } from 'react'

const SomeContext = createContext();

// Pass count / setCount in the "value" context
const Component = () => {
    const [count, setCount] = useState(0)

    const values = { count, setCount }

    return (
        <SomeContext.Provider value={values}>
            <ChildComponent />
        </SomeContext.Provider>
    )

}

const ChildComponent = () => {
    return (
        <section>
            <GrandChildComponent />
        </section>
    )
}

// access the counting state here!
const GrandChildComponent = () => {
    const { count, setCount } = useContext(SomeContext);

    const increment = () => {
        setCount(count + 1)
    }

    const decrement = () => {
        setCount(count - 1)
    }

    return (
        <div>
            <span>{count}</span>
            <button onClick={increment}>
                decrement
            </button>
            <button onClick={decrement}>
                decrement
            </button>
        </div>
    )
}

```

Ok that was pretty easy! What we're doing above is passing count and setCount through our component tree, letting all our
children components access the method / value without having to pass props through them.
Alright well now that we've gone through the simple example, lets take it a step further.

*** This is where the article gets quite a bit more complex... But I will try my best to walk you through it! ***

Lets use this as a method to manage more state by using `useReducer` and pass its values through context!

```jsx:title=src/components.js {}
import React, { createContext, useContext, useReducer } from 'react'

// We set an initial state value
const initialState = { count: 0 };

// We define what occurs to that state when invoked
const reducer = (state, action) => {
  switch (action.type) {
    case 'INCREMENT':
      return { count: state.count + 1 };
    case 'DECREMENT':
      return { count: state.count - 1 };
    default:
      throw new Error();
  }
}

// We pass the initial state into context
const SomeContext = createContext(initialState);

const Component = () => {
    const [state, dispatch] = useReducer(reducer, initialState);

    const values = [state, dispatch]

    return (
        <SomeContext.Provider value={values}>
            <ChildComponent />
        </SomeContext.Provider>
    )

}

const ChildComponent = () => {
    return (
        <section>
            <GrandChildComponent />
        </section>
    )
}

// We access our reducers from our grandchild component.
const GrandChildComponent = () => {
    const [state, dispatch] = useContext(SomeContext);

    const increment = () => {
        dispatch({ type: 'INCREMENT' });
    }

    const decrement = () => {
        dispatch({ type: 'DECREMENT' });
    }

    return (
        <div>
            <span>{state.count}</span>
            <button onClick={increment}>
                increment
            </button>
            <button onClick={decrement}>
                decrement
            </button>
        </div>
    )
}

```

This all seems like a lot of work just to pass a `count` and `setCount` through to a grand child component.
What happens if we want to include more state though? This is where things start to get interesting!
By using `useReducer` we're able to handle more complex states in our components. If we wanted to add
a counter clearer we could do that! What if we wanted to include a way to increase the `count` by 5 every button click.
Perhaps we wanted to include some other state to change the size or the colour of the counter. We could do that simply by adding
more state, and more reducers!

This is great and all, but you might be tired of having to `import` `useContext` and `SomeContext` into every child.

```

import React, { useContext } from 'react'
import { SomeContext } from 'src/stores/context'

...........
const [state, dispatch] = useContext(SomeContext);
```

Having the state object and dispatch functions really clutter up the application.
This is where custom hooks can be really useful.

```jsx:title=src/components.js {}
// We import useMemo to memoize the values passed through context
import React, { createContext, useContext, useReducer, useMemo } from 'react'

const initialState = { count: 0 };

const reducer = (state, action) => {
  switch (action.type) {
    case 'INCREMENT':
      return { count: state.count + 1 };
    case 'DECREMENT':
      return { count: state.count - 1 };
    default:
      throw new Error();
  }
}

const SomeContext = createContext(initialState);

// We write a custom hook for our context
// This can only be used within the tree of the parent component!
// Just incase it's not we'll throw an error
const useStore = () => {
  const context = useContext(SomeContext)
  if (context === undefined) {
    throw new Error(`useStore must be used within a Provider`)
  }
  return context
}

// In our parent component we set up what we want to pass through
// Memoizing the values and spreading the state
// All so we can access values and methods from the same object
const Component = () => {
    const [state, dispatch] = useReducer(reducer, initialState);

    const setCountIncrement = () => dispatch({ type: 'INCREMENT' })
    const setCountDecrement = () => dispatch({ type: 'DECREMENT' })

    const values = useMemo(
        () => ({
            ...state,
            setCountIncrement,
            setCountDecrement,
        }),
        [state]
    )

    return (
        <SomeContext.Provider value={values}>
            <ChildComponent />
        </SomeContext.Provider>
    )
}

const ChildComponent = () => {
    return (
        <section>
            <GrandChildComponent />
        </section>
    )
}

// Now throughout the application we can useStore!
// This reduces the imports and significantly cleans up
// the mess state / dispatch creates ðŸ˜Š
const GrandChildComponent = () => {
    const { count, setCountIncrement, setCountDecrement } = useStore()

    const increment = () => {
        setCountIncrement()
    }

    const decrement = () => {
        setCountDecrement()
    }

    return (
        <div>
            <span>{count}</span>
            <button onClick={increment}>
                increment
            </button>
            <button onClick={decrement}>
                decrement
            </button>
        </div>
    )
}

```

A few things we still need to keep in mind when using this technique. `dispatch` is asyncronous.
That means the methods (functions) we pass through context are also asyncronous.
Be careful when updating multiple states at once!

Another gotcha is dispatch within useEffect. Do not use it as a dependency otherwise
you'll create an inifinite loop. If you're using ESLint I like to `//eslint-disable-next-line` to
remove the recommendation to add it to the dependency array. If someone has a better way I would love to
hear about it!
