# Console Logging

>You may find yourself wanting more centralized control over the output to your console throughout your application.
Here's a little trick...


What if there was a better way to output to the console? A way where we don't have to
mass replace, comment out, and be conscious of the different stages of our app. What if we
could extract that logic and have the same function be used in development, staging and production?

#### Lets write a function!

```jsx:title=src/utils/log.js
export const log = () => {
    console.log()
}
```

It's just missing some parameters now. But what do we want to pass to our function?
Perhaps a message, the data, the method, anything else? Lets add those with defaults for now
in the case we want to omit them.

```jsx:title=src/utils/log.js
export const log = ({ data = null, message = '', variant = 'LOG' }) => {
    switch (variant) {
        case 'LOG':
            console.log(message, { data })
            break;
        case 'ERROR':
            console.error(message, { data })
            break;
        case 'TABLE':
            console.table(message, { data })
            break;
        case 'WARN':
            console.warn(message, { data })
            break;
        // etc...
        default:
            return
    }
}
```

We could stop here. But this wasn't enough for me.
I want my logs to show depending on the environment.


```jsx:title=src/utils/log.js {3-5}
const log = ({ data = null, message = '', variant = 'LOG' }) => {
    if(process.env.NODE_ENV === 'DEVELOPMENT') {
        switch (variant) {
            case 'LOG':
                console.log(message, { data })
                break;
            case 'ERROR':
                console.error(message, { data })
                break;
            case 'TABLE':
                console.table(message, { data })
                break;
            case 'WARN':
                console.warn(message, { data })
                break;
            default:
                return
        }
    }
}
```

Now we have granular control over how we display our logs in development, staging and production.
If we want even more control, we can move the `NODE_ENV` check inside our switch statement.
A simple but potentially useful little snippet that could save you time in the long run.
This is how we use our function.

```jsx:title=src/components/component.js
import { log } from 'src/utils/log'

const Component = (props) => {
    const [data, setData] = useState(null)

    const handleClick = (event) => {
        log({ message: 'clicked' })
    }

    useEffect(() => {
        const fetch = async () => {
            try {
                const fetchedData = await fetchingData()
                setData(fetchedData)
                log({ data: fetchedData, message: 'Response from API' })

            } catch (error) {
                log({ data: error, message: 'Error from API', variant: 'ERROR' })
            }
        }

        fetch()
    }, [])

    return (
        <section>
            {log({ data: props })}
            <div>This is how we logs</div>
            <button onClick={handleClick}>Click me!</button>
        </section>
    )
}
```

It takes a bit to get used to, especially with losing the syntax highlighting for `console.log` and having to import `log()` into each component you want to use it.
There are a million different ways we could take this, but it's just a start and I wanted to keep it simple.
Have any more ideas or similar use cases? [I would love to hear them!](/contact/)
