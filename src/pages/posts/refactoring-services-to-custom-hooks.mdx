# Refactoring Services to Custom Hooks

> A discussion on cleaning up components that make use of Apollo Client's `useMutation` hook.
 I found that by extracting the API service logic into a seperate folder, it's much easier to scale
 components, read components, and understand their functionality.

  I found that by seperating concerns, components were much easier to test, extend new features, prevent bugs and onboard new developers.

### Bloat in React

I love to write code in a single file. There's just something about it that screams "efficient & productive", until it's not.
No matter what feature I'm building, my tendency is to write multi-component files until it starts to get messy.
It's in this chaos that *real* developers are born.

Kidding.

But it is a skill that is important to learn as a developer. Breaking large components, delegating function calls, moving things around.
It's something that we all have to get use to.

This is how I solved component bloat.

Take a look at this component that creates a menu.
For brevity sake, I've skimmed the imports, removed styles and other form fields.

```jsx:title=src/components/CreateMenu.js
export const CreateMenu = ({ setIsOpen }) => {
  const [{ organizationId, image }, dispatch] = useContext(UserContext)
  const [addMenu, { data }] = useMutation(ADD_MENU)

  const { values, errors, handleChange, handleSubmit } = useForm({
    onSubmit: ({ values }) => {
      const { menuTitle } = values

      addMenu({
        variables: { organization_id: organizationId, title: menuTitle },
        update: (store, { data }) => {
          const menuData = store.readQuery({
            query: MENUS_BY_ORGANIZATION,
            variables: { organization_id: organization_id },
          })

          store.writeQuery({
            query: MENUS_BY_ORGANIZATION,
            variables: { organization_id: organization_id },
            data: {
              menusByOrganization: [
                ...menuData.menusByOrganization,
                data.addMenu,
              ],
            },
          })
        },
      }).then(() => {
        dispatch(menuCreated())
        setIsOpen(false)
      })
    },
  })

  return (
    <form onSubmit={handleSubmit}>
      <Field
        id="menuTitle"
        name="menuTitle"
        required
        label="Menu Title"
        placeholder="Ex. Drink Menu"
        value={values.menuTitle}
        onChange={handleChange}
        type="text"
        error={errors.menuTitle}
      />
      <Button type="submit">
        Create
      </Button>
    </form>
  )
}

```

I'm using a custom hook to handle the form and utilizing the **update** function to update Apollo's cache.

1.. First things first, I would like to be using async await.
Async await usually can make code easier to read and it makes sense to do so in this use case.

2.. That update function is a lot to take in (although sometimes necessary to have full control of the cache).

I want to extract all logic that's referencing my API in a **services** folder.
The idea behind doing so is to seperate the concerns.
In an ideal world, I would like to have components that handle state, components that handle view and components that handle servicing APIs.
I enjoy writing components like this as it becomes easier to test, debug, and understand what is going on.

Take a look at this snippet of code...

```jsx:title=src/components/CreateMenu.js {9-31}
export const CreateMenu = ({ setIsOpen }) => {
  const [{ organizationId, image }, dispatch] = useContext(UserContext)
  const [addMenu, { data }] = useMutation(ADD_MENU)

  const { values, errors, handleChange, handleSubmit } = useForm({
    onSubmit: ({ values }) => {
      const { menuTitle } = values

      addMenu({
        variables: { organization_id: organizationId, title: menuTitle },
        update: (store, { data }) => {
          const menuData = store.readQuery({
            query: MENUS_BY_ORGANIZATION,
            variables: { organization_id: organization_id },
          })

          store.writeQuery({
            query: MENUS_BY_ORGANIZATION,
            variables: { organization_id: organization_id },
            data: {
              menusByOrganization: [
                ...menuData.menusByOrganization,
                data.addMenu,
              ],
            },
          })
        },
      }).then(() => {
        dispatch(menuCreated())
        setIsOpen(false)
      })
    },
  })

  return (
    <form onSubmit={handleSubmit}>
      <Field
        id="menuTitle"
        name="menuTitle"
        required
        label="Menu Title"
        placeholder="Ex. Drink Menu"
        value={values.menuTitle}
        onChange={handleChange}
        type="text"
        error={errors.menuTitle}
      />
      <Button type="submit">
        Create
      </Button>
    </form>
  )
}
```
I want `CreateMenu` to be purely managing its state. Remember, I want to seperate the concerns of my components.
Although sometimes challenging, it's best practice in my opinion to *try* to abide by these soft rules in large scale react projects.

I'm going to extract the snippet of code above (the snippet that interacts with my API) and put it in its own `/services` folder.
I called this new function **handleCreateMenu**.

This new function takes 2 arguments, the mutation from the `useMutation` hook, and an `args` object which contains
variables for the mutation and an organizationId for updating the cache.


```js:title=src/services/menu.js
import { MENUS_BY_ORGANIZATION } from 'graphql/queries/menu/menusByOrganization'

export const handleCreateMenu = async (mutation, args) => {
  const { variables, organizationId } = args

  const data = await mutation({
    variables: variables,
    update: (store, { data }) => {
      const menuData: any = store.readQuery({
        query: MENUS_BY_ORGANIZATION,
        variables: { organization_id: organizationId },
      })

      store.writeQuery({
        query: MENUS_BY_ORGANIZATION,
        variables: { organization_id: organizationId },
        data: {
          menusByOrganization: [...menuData.menusByOrganization, data.addMenu],
        },
      })
    },
  })

  return data
}
```

Now we only need to import `MENUS_BY_ORGANIZATION` in a single file.
If we want to extract all other services such as `deleteMenu`, `editMenu`, `publishMenu`, etc... we would add them to this file within our `/services` directory.

This is how the component looks now.

```jsx:title=src/components/CreateMenu.js {6-14}
export const CreateMenu = ({ setIsOpen }) => {
  const [{ organizationId, image }, dispatch] = useContext(UserContext)
  const [addMenu, { data }] = useMutation(ADD_MENU)

  const { values, errors, handleChange, handleSubmit } = useForm({
    onSubmit: async ({ values }) => {
      const { menuTitle } = values
      const variables = { organization_id: organizationId, title: menuTitle }
      const args = { variables, organizationId }
      const data = await handleCreateMenu(addMenu, args).then(() => {
        dispatch(menuCreated())
        setIsOpen(false)
      })
    },
  })

  return (
    <form onSubmit={handleSubmit}>
      <Field
        id="menuTitle"
        name="menuTitle"
        required
        label="Menu Title"
        placeholder="Ex. Drink Menu"
        value={values.menuTitle}
        onChange={handleChange}
        type="text"
        error={errors.menuTitle}
      />
      <Button type="submit">
        Create
      </Button>
    </form>
  )
}
```

We're still not fully seperating concerns, but at least we're closer.
What really matters here is improving the speed at which we develop new features, reduce bugs and solve existing ones, onboarding new developers, and enjoying the building process!

Cheers to my first blog post!
