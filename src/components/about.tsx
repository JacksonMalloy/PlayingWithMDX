        As a firm believer in the future of the web, I have become vehemently obsessed with web technologies. From the
        countless hours I've spent studying about the web, I'm happy to call this one of my passions.
        <br />
        <br />
        My name is Jacks, and I'm an experienced full stack web developer from Vancouver BC. My specialty is with
        JavaScript/TypeScript - it's what study and write nearly every single day. Writing React.js is my most practiced
        skill in the JavaScript ecosystem. While I most enjoy writing React.js, other frameworks I'm familiar with are
        Angular and Svelte. I'm also very engaged in the GraphQL ecosystem.
        <br />
        <br />
        Web development, music and soccer are my favourite things to do in my spare time. I'm a very competitive person.
        I'm always up for a challenge. Perhaps it's why I'm so obsessed with learning about things that others have
        troubles understanding. There's something about diving "under the hood", destructuring the very architecture to
        understand technology, that I enjoy very much.
        <br />

        Happy you've read this far. I'm looking for opportunity and more work. If you're looking for an experience full
        stack devloper who lives in the React ecosystem I think I could really help! Regardless, if you'd just like to
        chat drop me a message here.
        <br />

        Thanks for reading, Have a great day!
